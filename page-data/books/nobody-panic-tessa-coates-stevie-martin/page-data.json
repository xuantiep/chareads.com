Got three dead houseplants, no debit card, and an exploded yoghurt in your bag? Useful, funny and life-affirming, Nobody Panic is an instruction manual for anyone with absolutely no idea what they're doing. From the creators of the critically acclaimed podcast comes a series of How To guides for everything from job interviews to leaving a WhatsApp group, from understanding the oven to dealing with your best friend's new (astoundingly dull) partner. There's also a poem about taxes. Comedians and professional panickers Tessa Coates and Stevie Martin are here to help you learn from their many, many mistakes, and remind you that when it comes to life, we're all in this together - so nobody panic.\n","tags":["form-audiobook","form-hardback","type-non-fiction"],"readDates":[["2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":6,"rating5":5,"pageCount":416,"dateRated":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateLastRead":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","sortingDate":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Tessa Coates, Stevie Martin","publisher":"Hodder & Stoughton","bookHeight":205,"series":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"h200":{"width":131,"height":200,"src":"/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":196,"height":300,"src":"/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/02d26/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/f2a7d/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/e49df/cover.jpg 2x"},"h400":{"width":261,"height":400,"src":"/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/e49df/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/aabf86b68c7f6835dbc8f71f60de220c/2d2bf/cover.jpg 2x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#BC7454","darkVibrant":"#0C2B4B","lightVibrant":"#E8B683","muted":"#AC7053","darkMuted":"#293E57","lightMuted":"#9BB1C8"}},"html":"<p>I loved this so much. I wouldn’t usually dream of reading a book with the subtitle ‘How to be a functioning adult without screaming’ but since becoming obsessed with Stevie and Tessa’s podcast Nobody Panic in September (and I mean true obsession, I’ve listened to their entire 5-year back catalogue of weekly episodes twice since then) I knew I needed to get the book. I waited to get the hardback as a Christmas present but I was too impatient to wait until I finished my Dickens to inhale it, so I got the audiobook, and damn was that the best choice I’ve made all year.</p>\n<p>Tessa and Stevie have such a lovely rapport, it’s like we’re all sat around a table with a few bottles of wine and they’re telling me how to get myself together. They’re also stonkingly hilarious, easily triple the laughs per minute compared to any other comedy podcast.</p>\n<p>I was worried the audiobook would be stilted compared to the breezy natter of the pod but it’s better than you could imagine. Most of the subjects and anecdotes from the book have also been covered by the podcast, but they’ve been refined and reformatted, and then the audio production (feat. sound effects) takes them to another level. My favourite sections were Tessa’s poem about tax, the oven symbol/Norse rune quiz, and the ‘how to rekindle a dead friendship’ tale told as a 19th-century novel. There are also so many asides tossed into the audiobook, it seems like they were having a delightful time recording it and I’m glad they mostly stayed in.</p>\n<p>If you want to be enormously entertained for a few hours but also come away feeling more equipped to face life’s challenges, you must get this book.</p>","relatedBooks":[{"id":"03dc44d4-403c-57e6-9080-e5cb5d35daf9-book","slug":"/books/will-will-smith/","title":"Will","author":"Will Smith","rating7":4,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"h150":{"width":99,"height":150,"src":"/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":230,"height":350,"src":"/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/76e49/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/53bc7/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/6f636a19ee09c2a5ef2e4a84fff5886a/4d6ac/cover.jpg 2x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#1DAFDC","darkVibrant":"#6C621B","lightVibrant":"#F4B567","muted":"#9A935C","darkMuted":"#5E4737","lightMuted":"#B2C8CC"}},"video":null},{"id":"9e91699c-a03b-538a-a558-e41bb3b05d4e-book","slug":"/books/somebodys-daughter-ashley-c-ford/","title":"Somebody’s Daughter","author":"Ashley C.
